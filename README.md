Iraq vs Iran: Annual Oil Production and Regional Conflict Timeline

This Power BI analysis explores the relationship between regional conflicts and crude oil production trends in Iraq and Iran from the 1970s to 2020. The project integrates multiple open data sources, cleans and transforms them using Power BI, and visualizes the economic impact of conflict on oil output.
Data Sources
    • Conflict Data: Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED)
    • Crude Oil Production: World Bank Data360 — IMF IFS AOMPC Indicator
Data Preparation and Transformation
The datasets were cleaned by removing unnecessary rows and columns. The oil production dataset was transformed in Power BI Query Editor by switching rows into columns for easier year-over-year comparison and readability. Countries affected by war were categorized, with a focus on Iraq and Iran.
Key Insights
Iran experienced a dramatic production drop in the late 1970s and early 1980s, during the Iran–Iraq War, falling from approximately 72,000 mb/d to 12,000 mb/d. The country showed a slow and inconsistent recovery until around 2017, followed by another decline from 53,000 to 30,000 mb/d between 2017 and 2020, largely due to renewed regional tensions and conflict involving Israel.
Iraq suffered three major production declines: in the 1980s during the Iran–Iraq War, in 1990 during the Gulf War (Desert Storm), and in 2003 during the U.S.-led invasion. Since 2003, Iraq has experienced a steady rise in production that aligns with the increase in global oil prices, reaching its highest level of approximately 56,600 mb/d in recent years.

Tools and Techniques
    • Power BI for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization
    • Power Query for restructuring raw data
    • Data modeling to align time-series data from multiple sources
    • Dual-axis charts to compare oil production (in barrels) against oil prices (USD)
Visualization Focus
The visualization highlights annual oil production trends from 1970 to 2020, annotated with markers representing regional conflicts. It illustrates how geopolitical instability corresponds with production fluctuations, allowing for a clearer understanding of the economic impact of war.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the strong correlation between geopolitical instability and oil production volatility in the Middle East. Both Iraq and Iran’s economies reveal how regional conflict timelines directly influenced energy output and global oil markets. The analysis underscores the importance of integrating conflict data with economic indicators to uncover the broader implications of war on national productivity.
